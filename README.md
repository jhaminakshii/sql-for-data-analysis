# SQL for Data Analysis

This repository contains my SQL practice exercises, progressing from **basic queries** 
to **advanced SQL topics** including window functions and real-world scenarios, aimed at strengthening database querying skills for **Data Analysis** and **Data Engineering** roles.


I’m using **SQL Server (SSMS)** to practice real-world scenarios and interview-style challenges.
